## Why
Keep the @todo count for each commit.

Do not allow commits if the total amount of @todo increased or is above a user-defined threshold.

Purpose is to keep the @todo list low and forcing cleaning the code or resolving them.

**Based on the ideas of:**

## Installation

Use [Composer](https://getcomposer.org) to install the package:

```
$ composer require --dev nilportugues/php_todo
```

## Usage

It is really this simple:

```
$ php bin/php_todo find <path/to/directory>
```

### Configuration file

- Define the todo annotations to look for in the code.
- Define the amount of @todo that will be tolerated.

When run the first time, if no `php_todo_finder.yml` file is found you will have to create it.

A configuration for instance, should formatted as follows:

```yml
todo_finder:
  total_allowed: 5
  expressions:
    - @todo
    - TODO
    - refactor
    - FIX ME
```

You can specify an alternate location for the configuration file by passing in the `-c` parameter. Example:

```
$  php bin/php_todo find -c configs/php_todo_finder.yml src/
```
